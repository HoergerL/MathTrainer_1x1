This is a really simple app to train the 1x1, which is dedicated to my little sister. Sadly she didn't want to do maths, even with that app, so I never implemented more features. :(

## How it works

The app creates a math task from the 1x1 and shows 4 different possible solutions. 
To make it a little bit more difficult the answers are not completely randomized, but close to the result.
You have to answer the task in between 5s. If you are not able to or if you answer wrong, the screen will be colored red for 0,5s and you will lose one point.
When you answer right, the screen turns green for 0,5s and you get one point. In any case you get a toast-message, which shows you feedback.
After 30s the game is up and the app shows your points and your highscore. From there you can try again or leave the app.
