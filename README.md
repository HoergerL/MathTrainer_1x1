# MathTrainer 1x1

#### Created in March 2020

This is a really simple app to practice the multiplication table up to 100 (german: 1x1), dedicated to my little sister. Sadly she didn't want to do maths, even with this app, so I never implemented more features. :(

## How it works
The app generates a task from the multiplication table to solve and gives the user 4 possible answers to choose from. To make it a little bit more difficult the answers are not completely randomized, but close to the result. The answer has to be submitted in under 5 seconds. If either the time runs out or the wrong answer has been chosen, the screen is will be colored red for 0.5 seconds and the player loses a point. If the answer is correct, the screen flashes green for 0.5 seconds and a point is awarded instead. In both cases the player gets a toast message as feedback. After a total of 30 seconds has passed the game is over and the current score alongside the highscore is displayed. The player may start again or leave the app at this point.
